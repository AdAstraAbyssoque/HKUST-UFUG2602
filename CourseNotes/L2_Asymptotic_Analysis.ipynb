    "渐进分析（Asymptotic Analysis）是一种用于描述算法性能的方式，特别是在计算机科学和数学中用于分析算法的时间复杂度和空间复杂度。\n",
    "\n",
    "在渐进分析中，我们主要关注输入规模趋于无穷大时的情况。换句话说，我们关注的是当输入规模足够大时，算法的行为表现。这就是为什么我们经常在算法分析中看到大O记号（$O$）、大Ω记号（$\\Omega$）和大Θ记号（$\\Theta$）。\n",
    "\n",
    "1. 大O记号（$O$）给出了算法的上界，表示在最坏的情况下，算法的运行时间（或空间）是多少。例如，如果一个算法的运行时间是 $O(n^2)$，那么当输入规模足够大时，算法的运行时间将不超过 $n^2$ 的某个常数倍。\n",
    "\n",
    "2. 大Ω记号（$\\Omega$）给出了算法的下界，表示在最好的情况下，算法的运行时间（或空间）是多少。例如，如果一个算法的运行时间是 $\\Omega(n)$，那么无论输入规模多大，算法的运行时间至少是 $n$ 的某个常数倍。\n",
    "\n",
    "3. 大Θ记号（$\\Theta$）给出了算法的紧确界，表示在平均情况下，算法的运行时间（或空间）是多少。例如，如果一个算法的运行时间是 $\\Theta(n \\log n)$，那么当输入规模足够大时，算法的运行时间将接近于 $n \\log n$ 的某个常数倍。\n",
    "\n",
    "渐进分析的主要优点是它可以帮助我们忽略常数因子和低阶项，使我们能够更清楚地看到算法性能随着输入规模增大的基本趋势。\n"

    "\n",
    "3. `while i >= 0 and a[i] > key:` The number of times this loop runs depends on the input data. It could run from 1 to $n-1$ times. We denote the number of times this loop runs as $\\sum_{j=1}^{n-1}t_j$, where $t_j$ is the number of times the $j^{th}$ iteration runs. We assume the time complexity of this loop is $c_4$.\n",
    "\n",

In the best case scenario (when the input is already sorted), each $t_j$ is 1, so the time complexity is $O(n)$. On average, the time complexity of the insertion sort algorithm is also $O(n^2)$."
